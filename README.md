#To do
- dissapearing number when you build roads
- try hovers for the towns
- as you discover towns add them to "towns" menu
- rename jobs menu to "towns" menu btw
- Set town names that relate to what they are (mill, weaver, fluffy sheepville)
- wait until x is delivered to make y available (grain -> flour, wool -> clothing)
- once level 2 items have been created, make people want them
- put mill next to river
- sounds: water, sheep, birds, wheels
- town types enum, different model based on type
- surround map with ocean below and mountains behind, as god intended

#later
- more area types
- little guy
- dialog and story, lol
